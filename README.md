# CSCI4100-Group-Project

This project solves a basic course scheduling problem using graph coloring and room assignment. It makes sure no conflicting courses happen at the same time and avoids double-booking rooms. Pretty useful if youâ€™re trying to schedule finals or build a class timetable.

## How It Works

There are 4 Python files in this project:

### `main.py`
This is the main script that ties everything together. It:
- Defines course conflicts (same professor, same students, etc.).
- Builds a conflict graph.
- Uses a greedy coloring algorithm to assign time slots.
- Assigns rooms so there are no overlaps in the same time slot.
- Prints the schedule before and after adding a new course (C7).

### `color_graph.py`
Handles the **time slot assignment**. It uses a greedy graph coloring algorithm:
- Each course is a node.
- If two courses conflict, they get different "colors" (a.k.a. time slots).
- Greedy = fast but not guaranteed to be optimal.

### `assign_rooms.py`
Takes the time slots and assigns rooms to courses:
- Makes sure no two courses share the same room at the same time.
- If all rooms are taken in a time slot, the course gets `"No Room Available"`.

### `print_schedule.py`
Just formats and prints the final schedule so it's readable:
